# Student-lifestyle-and-stress-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing student lifestyle and academic data to understand how daily habits influence stress levels and academic performance. The analysis follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow, combining Python-based data cleaning and exploratory analysis with an interactive Power BI dashboard for insight delivery.

📊 Student Lifestyle & Stress Data Analysis
📌 Overview

This project analyzes student lifestyle and academic data to understand how daily habits influence stress levels and academic performance. It follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow, using Python for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze the impact of sleep duration, screen time, physical activity, study hours, and social media usage on student stress.

Identify behavioral patterns affecting academic performance (CGPA).

Deliver data-driven insights to support student well-being and productivity.

Demonstrate a real-world Python + Power BI analytics workflow.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains student demographic, lifestyle, and academic information, including:

Age, Gender

Sleep Duration (hours)

Screen Time (hours)

Physical Activity Level

Study Hours

Social Media Usage (hours)

Stress Level

CGPA

The dataset includes 60,000+ student records, providing reliable insights.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis of sleep, screen time, and stress levels

Relationship analysis between sleep vs stress and study hours vs CGPA

Gender-based and age-based stress comparisons

Correlation and multivariate analysis

📈 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard includes:

KPI cards (Average Stress, Sleep Duration, Screen Time, Total Students)

Sleep Duration vs Stress Level

CGPA vs Study Hours

Stress by Age and Gender

Screen Time and Social Media Usage Distribution

Interactive slicers allow dynamic filtering for deeper analysis.

🔍 Key Insights

Students with adequate sleep (7–8 hours) tend to have lower stress levels.

Excessive screen time is associated with increased stress and reduced sleep quality.

Moderate physical activity supports better stress management.

CGPA improves with consistent study hours, while excessive studying can lead to burnout.

Stress levels increase during later academic years.

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can be used to uncover meaningful patterns in student behavior. Combining Python-based analysis with Power BI dashboards enables effective insight communication and supports data-driven decision-making for improving student well-being.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Predictive modeling for student stress risk

Time-series analysis for behavioral trends

Real-time dashboard integration
